# Repo about FPGA stuff

My FPGA playground.

I have a TinyFPGA BX to run experiments on. 

So the examples I will provide will be tweaked for it. 

Examples:
- out_pin - example of pushing bits out of a pin (PIN 1) on a clock cycle. 
- out_pin_testbench - example with a testbench (wont work on board tho)
- out_pin_not - example with a not on PIN 
- notGate - a NOT gate example
